# WEEK 2: CODE CHALLENGE

## DESCRIPTION 

`Flataculties`, an app where you can vote for the cutest animal! You will use a local API and build out the frontend for our app. 

## Implementation

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* JSON


## Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

* See a list of all animal names. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the character data
* Click on an animal’s name to see its details i.e image and number of votes. Note, you should only be displaying the details of one animal at a time. You can either use the character information from your first request or make a new request to this endpoint to get the character's details 
* When viewing an animal’s details, I should be able to add the number of votes for each animal. This number of votes should then be displayed together with the animal’s details. No persistence is needed for the votes.

### Bonus Deliverables
These bonus deliverables are here if you want an extra challenge and won't affect your score.

Make sure to commit your work to save your progress before attempting the bonus deliverables!

1. Add a reset button that resets the votes back to 0
2. Have a form for adding animals.
